# RipTools
A wip addon for Blender to aid in the ripping and modifiying of video game assets

Currently includes the Bone Merger panel, which allows for bones to follow the positions of other bones with the same name between armatures, useful for multipart models that make use of modular armatures such as characters with different armor sets
